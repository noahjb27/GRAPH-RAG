# GraphRAG Transport Pipeline Guide

## Overview

The GraphRAG Transport Pipeline is a sophisticated analysis system inspired by Microsoft's GraphRAG approach, specifically adapted for transport network data analysis. Unlike traditional RAG systems that focus on unstructured text, this pipeline leverages your existing structured transport graph to provide hierarchical community-based analysis of Berlin's historical transport network.

**✅ Production Status**: Fully deployed with 137MB+ cached communities and summaries covering 1,143 community scenarios across all years and community types.

## Core Concepts

### What is GraphRAG for Transport Networks?

GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation) for transport networks combines:

1. **Hierarchical Community Detection**: Automatically identifies meaningful clusters in your transport network
2. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Analyzes communities across geographic, operational, temporal, and service-type dimensions
3. **Hierarchical Summarization**: Uses LLMs to generate comprehensive summaries of transport communities
4. **Global Search**: Answers complex, system-wide questions through map-reduce summarization

### Key Advantages

- **Answers "Global" Questions**: Excels at questions requiring understanding of the entire transport system
- **Leverages Existing Graph Structure**: No need to extract entities from text - uses your Neo4j graph directly
- **Multi-dimensional Communities**: Detects communities based on geography, operations, service types, and temporal patterns
- **Historical Context**: Understands the political and temporal context of divided Berlin (1946-1989)

## Community Detection Strategies

### 1. Geographic Communities

**Purpose**: Groups stations and lines by administrative boundaries and spatial proximity

**Detection Methods**:
- **Level 0**: Bezirk-based grouping (highest administrative level)
- **Level 1**: Ortsteil-based grouping (neighborhood level)
- **Spatial Clustering**: Geographic coordinate-based clustering

**Output**: Communities representing geographic regions with their transport infrastructure

### 2. Operational Communities

**Purpose**: Identifies functionally related transport infrastructure based on network topology

**Detection Methods**:
- **Leiden Algorithm**: Advanced community detection on station-line connectivity graph
- **Topological Analysis**: NetworkX graph analysis of service patterns
- **Connectivity Patterns**: Groups stations/lines by operational relationships

**Output**: Communities representing operationally connected transport infrastructure

### 3. Service Type Communities

**Purpose**: Groups transport infrastructure by service characteristics

**Detection Methods**:
- **Transport Mode Clustering**: Groups by U-Bahn, S-Bahn, tram, bus, ferry, etc.
- **Operational Metrics**: Considers capacity, frequency, route length
- **Service Quality**: Analyzes performance characteristics

**Output**: Communities representing each transport service type (e.g., "U-Bahn Network", "Tram Network")

### 4. Temporal Communities

**Purpose**: Identifies transport infrastructure evolution patterns over time

**Detection Methods**:
- **Activity Period Analysis**: Uses CoreStation activity_period data
- **Temporal Buckets**: Groups by historical eras (Post-war, Pre-wall, Wall era, Late era)
- **Evolution Patterns**: Tracks infrastructure development over time

**Output**: Communities representing transport development in different historical periods

## Community Summarization

### LLM-based Summarization Process

Each detected community is analyzed using specialized prompts that consider:

1. **Infrastructure Overview**: Station counts, line counts, transport types
2. **Operational Metrics**: Average capacity, frequency, network length
3. **Geographic Context**: Administrative areas, spatial coverage
4. **Historical Context**: Political divisions, temporal development
5. **Strategic Importance**: Role in overall Berlin transport system

### Example Community Summary

```
## Community: U-Bahn Network
**Type**: Service Type
**Political Context**: Mixed (East/West)

### Infrastructure Overview
- **Stations**: 45 stations
- **Lines**: 12 lines
- **Transport Types**: u-bahn

### Operational Metrics
- **Average Capacity**: 850 passengers
- **Average Frequency**: 5.2 minutes
- **Total Network Length**: 89.4 km

### Historical Analysis
The U-Bahn network represents Berlin's rapid transit backbone, with high-capacity 
underground services primarily serving central areas. During the Cold War period, 
the network was particularly significant as it crossed both East and West sectors...
```

## Query Processing

### Global vs Local Question Detection

The pipeline automatically determines whether a question requires:

**Global Analysis** (uses community summaries):
- Questions about overall patterns, trends, comparisons
- System-wide analysis requirements
- Political division impacts
- Historical development patterns

**Local Analysis** (fallback to existing pipelines):
- Specific station or line queries
- Route planning requests
- Individual entity information

### Global Search Process

1. **Community Detection**: Identify relevant communities for the question
2. **Community Summarization**: Generate or retrieve LLM summaries
3. **Map Phase**: Each community summary answers the question independently
4. **Reduce Phase**: Combine all community answers into comprehensive response

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from backend.pipelines.graphrag_transport_pipeline import GraphRAGTransportPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = GraphRAGTransportPipeline()

# Process a global transport question
result = await pipeline.process_query(
    question="What are the main transport development patterns in Berlin?",
    llm_provider="openai",
    year_filter=1961,
    community_types=["geographic", "service_type"]
)

print(result.answer)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Process with specific community types
result = await pipeline.process_query(
    question="How did East-West division affect transport infrastructure?",
    llm_provider="openai",
    year_filter=1961,
    community_types=["geographic", "temporal"]
)

# Access additional metadata
print(f"Communities analyzed: {result.metadata['communities_analyzed']}")
print(f"Question type: {result.metadata['question_type']}")
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Chatbot Pipeline Integration

The GraphRAG Transport Pipeline is automatically integrated with the chatbot pipeline and will be selected for appropriate questions:

- **Global transport questions**: System-wide analysis queries
- **Complex temporal questions**: Transport network evolution
- **Political division questions**: East/West infrastructure comparison

### Pipeline Selection Logic

The chatbot pipeline routes questions to GraphRAG Transport when:
- Global transport indicators are detected
- Complex temporal transport analysis is needed
- Political division context is relevant

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Community Caching**: Communities are cached by year and type
2. **Summary Caching**: LLM-generated summaries are cached and reused
3. **Selective Processing**: Only relevant communities are processed for each query
4. **Efficient Detection**: Optimized Neo4j queries for community detection

### Cost Management

- **LLM Usage**: Controlled through caching and selective processing
- **Map-Reduce Efficiency**: Only relevant communities contribute to answers
- **Fallback Strategy**: Local questions use existing, cheaper pipelines

## Question Types Best Suited for GraphRAG Transport

### Ideal Question Types

1. **System-wide Analysis**:
   - "What are the main transport development patterns in Berlin?"
   - "How did transport coverage change over time?"

2. **Political Division Impact**:
   - "How did East-West division affect transport infrastructure?"
   - "What were transport differences between sectors?"

3. **Historical Development**:
   - "What transport innovations emerged in different periods?"
   - "How did transport policy evolve over time?"

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - "Compare transport infrastructure in different Bezirke"
   - "Which areas had the best transport connectivity?"

### Less Suitable Question Types

1. **Specific Route Planning**: Use Path Traversal Pipeline
2. **Individual Entity Details**: Use Direct Cypher Pipeline
3. **Real-time Information**: Use appropriate real-time pipelines

```bash
# Test full pipeline functionality
